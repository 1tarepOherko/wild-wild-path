## What is Pdf Matchitecture?
 
Pdf Matchitecture is a build-up puzzle toy that uses wooden microbeams to create realistic models of various objects. The microbeams are thin sticks that measure 2.38 x 0.08 x 0.08 inches (6 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm). They are glued together according to the plans, which show the exact position and number of each microbeam. The plans are printed on paper and cut out to form templates that guide the assembly process. The result is a sturdy and detailed model that can be painted or decorated as desired.

## How to Build Pdf Matchitecture Models?
 
To build Pdf Matchitecture models, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Print the PDF file of the plan you downloaded. Make sure you print it at 100% scale and use good quality paper.
2. Cut out the templates along the dotted lines. Be careful not to cut the solid lines, which indicate where to place the microbeams.
3. Glue the templates on a cardboard or foam board base. This will make it easier to work on your model and prevent it from moving.
4. Start gluing the microbeams on the templates according to the instructions. Use a small amount of glue and apply it on both ends of each microbeam. You can use tweezers or a needle-nose pliers to help you position the microbeams precisely.
5. Remove the templates once the glue is dry. You can use a cutter or scissors to cut them off gently.
6. Add any finishing touches to your model, such as painting, varnishing, or decorating it.

Congratulations! You have completed your Pdf Matchitecture model!
